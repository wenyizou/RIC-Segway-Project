This project is a fully integrated system for controlling a Segway motor connected to a PIC32 micro-controller, complete with sensors for detecting obstacles and imbalances. Designed and implemented a user interface (Html, Javascript, AJAX) and a CLI (Matlab) for providing commands to the PIC32 and receiving feedback, sensors programming, as well as a driver(C++) for accessing the Segway motor via the PIC32. Also using library to integrated a WiFi communication system to allow for controlling the Segway remotely.
